                            <p>Artifact 0, also known as the Multimodal Diagnostic Video, was the first assignment that we were challenged to work on for ENGL 1101 course. At first look, it seemed like an assignment seeking to give the faculty an idea of the common mindset the enrolled students, but it was actually a challenge for the students to test their then WOVEN communication skills. I started out with a small script I prepared to aid myself during the recording in Clough Undergraduate Learning Center and soon realized this was a task that was not as simple as it seemed (again, in the first look). 85 retakes, six hours of work, and a ton of experience in oral and visual communication later, here is what I came up with. </p>

                            <h2 style="color:#2e6c80;font-size:12pt;">Communicating your ideas is one of the crucial parts of any business / non-business transaction, and to be able to communicate your ideas orally has often been one of the quickest ways to pitch opinions. In a world where people do a bit over a million transactions every second, it becomes crucial to master the skill of efficiently embedding your thoughts in the minds of the listener by eloquent usage of words and voice.</h2>

                            <div id="row_2" class="row">
                                <div id="row_2_column_1" class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8">
                                    <p>Personally, conveying thoughts and proposing ideas through speech has always been a challenge for me. Be it speaking in front of the entire school or in soliloquy, fumbling over the log of voice modulation to bring out the hidden beauty of excellent choice of diction and mind-boggling facts is a place where I am often at my wit’s end.</p>
                                    <p>The dreadful thought of tripping during an important speech / presentation still haunts me: The moment I messed up an introduction speech in an annual event of my high school just because I was too occupied with the thought, “Rachit, you ought not to bring in non-perfection today,” could be prevented, otherwise. Being afraid from a challenge is what most of the players are afraid of, and this fear of not performing well in the task is often what is to blame rather than the player himself.</p>
                                    <p>Facing a problem head-on is a solution I recently figured out to exist while I was working on perfecting my singing skills for my (Vocal) Music class in Grade 12. Some people might consider this method to be inadequate since this might exhaust the user of this technique, but in my opinion, that’s worth the results. ENGL 1101 is a course which offer tons of similar assignments where you are challenged to communicate your thoughts through the WOVEN method, with the Oral method being one of them. Preparing video artifacts, developing group podcasts, and giving general presentations are just some of the tasks that the course participants are required to tackle – all of which directly require exploiting the oral communication skills.</p>

                            <p>By the conclusion of this course, I intend to master the skill of using all of the modes of the WOVEN method of broadcasting ideas – be it to an individual in a chamber or the entire university, hopefully, during the sophomore welcome at the upcoming freshmen convocation. I hope to grab in all the arrows of tips thrown at the class by the professor and my classmates throughout the semester, and I intend to conclude the year with a quiver full of new skills adding in to my game of archery of life.</p>
