                        <p>Artifact 1 required us to represent time using any mode of WOVEN communication we needed. As simple as it may sound, I soon figured out that answering the question, "How do I represent time," was not very simple. After spending several days on brainstorming what I wanted to work on and talking with more than 50 people in class and out of class on their opinion of time, I came up with the idea of taking a bit of help of what I held more experience in (coding) to represent time. For this artifact, I developed a light web applet that could take in information related to what you usually do in a typical week and could then predict what perception of available and spent time a person might have on long and short terms.</p>

                            <li>The goal of this assignment was to represent time in an interactive way - in a way that makes it easier for the audience to comprehend time, perhaps, even providing them with a new set of lens to see it.</li>
                            <li>After having gone through this artifact, the audience was intended to have learnt something new related to what they know about time / to have their mental perception of time changed in some intriguing way.</li>

                            <li>The main argument of my artifact was to focus on displaying how a person's mind can assume the time available differently when asked to do certain tasks in the near future (say, in the next week) and when asked to do the same tasks in far past (say, in the first week of the past month.</li>
                            <li>The way my artifact works is by accepting data through a form, and then emailing over the prediction (also known as, <i>the results</i>) back to the user.</li>
                            <li>Often, the results provided by the web applet are quite interesting to the extent that they might not have thought about it before. While testing my web applet in real world and interviewing people whom I asked to test it, I found out that the results were surprisingly close to what they might have otherwise thought if they were asked to do just one of the two tasks.</li>

                            <li>In my artifact, I made sure that the application's algorithm took into account most of the tasks an average student participates in on weekly basis while also adding in a bit of room for the student to enjoy using the application.</li>
