                        <p>Artifact 2 required us to discuss the effects of scientific advancements on human perception of time. This artifact was to be produced in groups, and my group decided to work on 'Effects of Caffeine and Alcohol on Human Perception of Time'. Along with Grady, I set out to work on the script of the podcast and immersed myself into research papers from scientists like Ferre and Lapp. Several revisions and some peer review sessions later, we were finally ready with the podcast script. I then made sure that everything went as planned out in the script, and this is what we came up with.</p>

                        <p>I was responsible for making sure that we achieve our final objective of informing the audience about the effects of caffeine and alcohol on the human body. To do that, I took a lot of help from one of the workshops we had in class on developing podcasts. Here is the file that our group used to make sure that we did our best in transmitting our idea to the listeners.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Revision is key to improvement, and similar was the case in our situation. We had so much say in about 12 - 15 minutes that we could not fit everything in to the podcast. Let me share our draft scripts to show how we progressed from Ground 0 to Final Draft.</p>
                        <h3>DRAFT - 0</h3>
                        <embed src="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rbhargava36_gatech_edu/ESTVZVbnhphPtdudTvBl2P4BTTt53n0B14L87kTf_rFJtQ?e=XsG4Ha&download=1" width="100%" height="480" type="application/pdf">
                        <p>This draft had just enough for us to proceed with the research. It contained a brief idea of what we planned to work on comprised in a few lines.</p>
                        <h3>DRAFT - 1</h3>
                        <embed src="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rbhargava36_gatech_edu/ESmIUy_1x-hChXyiSqXEyvoBf_E84MTXKt-TClEJQ_4Z4A?e=GFCLow&download=1" width="100%" height="480" type="application/pdf">
                        <p>Soon, I and Grady (we were working on most of the script) worked on gathering all the information and formulated the next draft file for everyone else in the group to have a look. This was also the one that was shared with another group for peer review.</p>
                        <h3>DRAFT - 2</h3>
                        <embed src="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rbhargava36_gatech_edu/EfxRqtQCI99Mi-PSSPH6KEQBe4dZZLk4pspeNf80Y70tJA?e=G4yGov&download=1" width="100%" height="480" type="application/pdf">
                        <p>After receiving feedback from our course professor and another podcast group in the class, we brought in a few changes to make everything move a bit faster. This meant bringing in some minor changes to lay down the facts in a bit concrete way and also adding in some references to increase the overall credibility of what we discussed in the podcast.</p>
                        <h3>FINAL DRAFT</h3>
                        <embed src="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rbhargava36_gatech_edu/EX8DZDErtRZGprLHbhkzA2QBnKt_90AtotHiA0I-8qgnYw?e=NQPxf9&download=1" width="100%" height="480" type="application/pdf">
                        <p>The final draft had a lot of fillers moved out and some unnecessary sections deleted. It also contained some brief final instructions for the length of each section of the podcast. This was the document that we used during the final production of the artifact.</p>

                            <li>We gathered information from papers like “Psychopharmacological effects of alcohol on time perception” and “Alcohol and Caffeine: The Perfect Storm” and mentioned quotes from scientists like Ferre and Lapp to add credibility to our argument.</li>
