                        <p>Artifact 3 required us to give a group presentation on a scientific topic related to time. This was another group project, and my group decided to work on the topic 'The Standard Model: Why Canâ€™t Time Flow Backwards?' It did not take for us and the professor to realize that this was a very complicated topic, and we were soon in middle of extensive research work. I still remember the moment when I and Alex were discussing on the chronological order of the violation of different symmetries that earlier held the Standard Model together. After we had gathered all the necessary information, we set out to working on the outline of the presentation. Soon after, we worked on the script of the presentation, revised it a bit on the basis of feedback we received, rehearsed a bit before giving the final group presentation, and here is how we finally presented.</p>

                        <p>The format of a presentation, or the steps in which facts are laid in a presentation, is often the deciding factor in does your audience actually comprehend from what you just said. This is something that my group was concerned about before we actually begun working on this artifact, and as a result, we formulated a five-step approach to laying our facts down while discussing how the current Time Symmetry holds the entire Standard Model of universe together:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Discussion on Parity Symmetry</li>
                            <li>Discussion on Charge Symmetry</li>
                            <li>Discussion on Time Symmetry (Independently)</li>
                            <li>Explanation of Standard Model and How Does It Matter In Our Discussion</li>
                            <li>Violations of Symmetries</li>
                            <li>Elaboration on How the Current Standard Model is Held Together by Charge-Parity-Time Symmetry</li>
                            <li>Overall Review</li>

                        <p>Just like our presentation, we wanted to move in steps while preparing our artifact. As a result, our script preparation stage was also broken down into several stages:</p>
                        <h3>DRAFT - 0</h3>
                        <embed src="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rbhargava36_gatech_edu/EZNlIkwFWcJAjkptHPoa2owB1f1KtjNxdSY6xs6tQS3Tpg?e=V2oo2f&download=1" width="100%" height="480" type="application/pdf">
                        <p>This draft had an overall outline for how we shall proceed in our presentation. We used it more like a guideline while working on our next draft.</p>
                        <h3>DRAFT - 1</h3>
                        <embed src="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rbhargava36_gatech_edu/ER4U2lGa_2ZOpREfAIgyiTwBD9o670EagqjldLqAR5YdNg?e=2DgHv2&download=1" width="100%" height="480" type="application/pdf">
                        <p>Draft 1 was a result of extensive research done by the entire team on our topic of discussion. We used the previous draft and worked on it by adding in more information and the sources we gathered the information from. At this point, we were confident that this is what presented our overall discussion in text.</p>
                        <h3>DRAFT - 2</h3>
                        <embed src="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rbhargava36_gatech_edu/EWT1ZTSpSd9Pp2aa0_fAeb8BMK78q_fvp3_DVmqIsdmIzw?e=R9T8I3&download=1" width="100%" height="480" type="application/pdf">
                        <p>Draft 2 was the product of several rounds of feedback exchange with the course professor and everyone else we knew. We incorporated their suggestions, adding in a bit more information, thus making the script apparently absolute in itself.</p>
                        <h3>FINAL DRAFT</h3>
                        <embed src="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rbhargava36_gatech_edu/EZSud_aVje1MpN292Fo5L-sBqzoGkixvunYsGp_Lvnp9gQ?e=7p4e6y?e=NQPxf9&download=1" width="100%" height="480" type="application/pdf">
                        <p>Coming right next was the rehearsal phase, where we realized that our presentation was exceeding the time limit by about 12 minutes. As a result, we removed some of the unnecessary / not-so-relevant information from the script and added in a few in-presentation cues to help everyone stay connected with the ongoing discussion.</p>

                            <li>Apart from using just a PowerPoint Presentation, we decided to make everything a bit more interactive by inviting the audience to participate in some fun activities that we used to explain some otherwise-hard-to-comprehend concepts.</li>

                            <li>We made our choice of audience explicit in our presentation by starting from Ground 0, introducing new information to the audience, establishing the facts and explaining with the usage of several metaphors, inviting them to participate in an activity, and finally moving to the deep end of the discussion, thus making sure that even those who had no previous knowledge of the subject could comprehend what we debated.</li>
